# Goals

Create a synthetic dataset to test fuzzy matching approaches. Ideally, I'd like to use some sort of generative approach: drawing from distributions of common individual names, U.S. cities weighted by population, top employers, common job titles, etc.

# Setup

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)

# Hide the dplyr .groups message
options(dplyr.summarise.inform = FALSE)
```
